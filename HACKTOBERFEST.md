We value improvements that genuinely help maintainers, users, or the project‚Äôs maintainability.  
Here are some examples of valuable contributions:

## ‚öôÔ∏è Best Practices Before Opening a PR

Follow these general guidelines for a smoother and faster review:

1. **Create a new branch** with a meaningful name (for example, `docs/hacktoberfest-welcome` or `fix/compression-comment`).  
2. **Keep your commits focused** - one logical change per commit makes review easier.  
3. **Use clear and consistent commit messages**, such as  `docs: add HACKTOBERFEST.md to guide new contributors`.  
4. **Pull the latest changes** from the main branch before you start working to prevent conflicts.  
5. **Ensure the project builds successfully** and existing tests pass.  
6. **Write a short, clear pull request description** explaining what and why you changed something.  

Maintainers appreciate thoughtful, accurate, and concise updates.
